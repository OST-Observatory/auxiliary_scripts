# these are basic instruction to reduce DADOS data using
# two python scripts:
~/scripts/evolved/1_findcaliblines.py
~/scripts/evolved/2_extractspectrum.py

# the data taken during the seminar can be found in these folders,
# ordered by the observation date

~/data/20190902/
~/data/20190903/
~/data/20190905/
~/data/20190906/

# dark frames can be found here:
~/data/20190903/dark/

# in case calibration (arc) or flat field files are missing,
# use the closest ones

#####
# stack all hgar images and all flat images for object
#####

# the stacked images should have to same exposure time
# go into midas
inmidas -p 19
# set the dados context
SET/CONT dados
# replace star_1200s with the correct name!
STACK/DADO star_1200s*.FIT
# this will create a file with the .mt ending 
# you can rename this file to .fit if you like, but it is not necessary
# or
STACK/DADO star_1200s_0.FIT star_1200s_1.FIT
# this will create the stacked file called star_1200s_0_stacked.fit
# in this exampl

######
# then run the calibration using the stacked files
######

# first find the region you want to extract
# you can use ds9 or specify your science spectrum
~/scripts/evolved/1_findcaliblines.py  -arc star_hgar_stacked.fit -sc star_1200s_stacked.fit

# if you know the region, abort and start again with -rsc
~/scripts/evolved/1_findcaliblines.py  -arc star_hgar_stacked.fit -rsc 500 570

######
# then apply the calibration
######

# you need to put the flat fields in their own folder
mkdir flats
# and then copy your flat fields into that folder
cp *flat_1s* flats

# then you can extract the final spectra
# make sure that the dark frames are the correct length
# e.g. if the flats were taken with 1s, the -fd directory has
# to contain dark frames with 1s exposure time
~/scripts/evolved/2_extractspectrum.py -sc star_1200s_stacked.fit -df ~/data/20190903/dark/1200s/ -ff flats/ -fd ~/data/20190903/dark/1s/ -rsc 500 570

# the script will create a pdf plot of the final spectrum (star_spectrum.pdf)
# it will also create ascii files that contain the spectrum at different stages during the reduction
# _sky means that the sky (or background) spectrum was substracted
# _f means that the flat field correction was applied
# you can plot these ascii files using gnuplot:
gnuplot
# then type
p 'spectrum_science_sky_f.dat' w l

# in case you want to have line identifications in the pdf plot (star_spectrum.pdf),
# you can set the -pi option to "yes":
~/scripts/evolved/2_extractspectrum.py -sc star_1200s_stacked.fit -df ~/data/20190903/dark/1200s/ -ff flats/ -fd ~/data/20190903/dark/1s/ -rsc 500 570 -pi yes

# the script will then label the position of lines listed in lines.txt
# you need to create this file yourself, for example just copy the absorbtionlines file
# to lines.txt; it needs to be in the current directory
# a line in lines.txt might look like this:
